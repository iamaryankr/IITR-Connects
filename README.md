Hello, this is my project in which I have made a full-stack web application which connects people of IITR.
It is similar to using any other social media app, I built this project with the of my knowledge acquired by doing courses 
on web-development on UDEMY. Also some youtube tutorials were used.

For front-end => I have used React.js, html5, css3, Redux, Hooks, React-DOM, Vite and so on..
For back-end => I have used Node.js, Express.js, Sockets, Cloudinary and so on..
For Database => I have used MongoDB online cloud.
--I have not yet deployed the app--

*INSTRUCTIONS TO SETUP*
1. git clone ""
2. setup the .env file, for that you have to create a cloudinary account and MongoDB account(both being free).
.env should look like this ->
PORT=
MONGO_URI=
JWT_SECRET=
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=	
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=

3. npm install
4. npm run build
5. npm start
